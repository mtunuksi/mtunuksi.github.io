Welcome to my analysis of red wine quality prediction using R. This project explores the relationship between physicochemical properties, such as fixed acidity and alcohol content, and sensory quality ratings, leveraging advanced data analysis techniques in R. As an Industrial Chemist with a passion for data-driven quality control, I aim to provide actionable insights for winemakers and quality assurance professionals. Explore this project to see how I combine chemical expertise with statistical modeling to predict wine quality[here](https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/v2/D4D2DAQGjFd_K1A9jtw/profile-treasury-document-pdf-analyzed/profile-treasury-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1685986437242?e=1750291200&v=beta&t=Miz5VtJnz6CnO65pVBQuOlU2CldyS2sHQy1EZuA8bL4)
