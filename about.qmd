## Ian Zablon.

I’m an Industrial Chemist and Data Analyst passionate about transforming science into actionable insights for Kenyan industries and beyond. With experience at PBORA and as a freelance data analyst, I specialize in chemical analysis, data visualization, and leveraging tools like R to solve complex problems. Whether it’s optimizing manufacturing processes or uncovering trends in datasets, I’m driven to make a tangible impact. Outside of work, I’m inspired by Kenya’s vibrant innovation scene and enjoy exploring data-driven solutions for local challenges.
